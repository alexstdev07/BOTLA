Hello everyone!
We are Team NEMESIS, made up of Lupes Alex Ștefan, Gogoană David, and Rusu Feraru Theodor. We’re participating in the GameDev category of the national competition FiiCode with our game Blueprints of the Lost Age. The game was developed in Unity and features a compelling story that fits perfectly with the scenario required by the organizers.

– TRAILER –

Our game, Blueprints of the Lost Age, is a 2D roguelike created in Unity, inspired by titles like The Binding of Isaac. The gameplay centers around the player battling various monsters across multiple rooms, ultimately facing the FINAL BOSS.

The player can upgrade their weapon throughout the game – starting with a simple wooden sword and progressing all the way to the legendary laser sword. To restore health, the player can drink from magical fountains, but be warned – their use is limited!

The story follows the evolution of Brian, the character controlled by the player. The game also features a complex UI, including an intro menu with options like New Game, Continue, and Quit. The Continue option allows players to pick up from their last save.

During gameplay, pressing Escape brings up the pause menu, where players can adjust volume settings, save progress, upgrade weapons, and view Brian’s stats.

We hope you enjoy the game, and we’re excited to see you at the finals!
Nemesis out!
